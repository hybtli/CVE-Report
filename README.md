# Project Name: CVE Report Generator

## Project Description
The CVE Report Generator is a Python script that allows you to fetch and compile information about a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID. It retrieves data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Exploit Database to provide detailed information about a specific CVE.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3. x
- Requests library
- BeautifulSoup library
- docx library (for creating Word reports)
- reportlab library (for creating PDF reports)

You can install the required libraries using pip with the following command:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-docx reportlab
```

## Instructions for Running the Project
